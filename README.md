# Welcome to the Repository!
This repository is going to be a personally used/release repo for project I am working on, release to public, and any old projects that anyone can use if they feel. This have NO warranty, may contain security issues, and, if you want to use it, may require being worked on.

### How to obtain a specific project
Each project will have its own directory in the repo that will be pulled and pushed to. No new branches *should* be made, unless I use them for current projects and for their versioning control.

Security is **AS IS, NOT GUARANTEED, AND HAS NO WARRANTY.**

Any current project being developed will have security pages as well.

Current projects will have the *"Current-project"* tag.

Old projects **NOT** for public release will have *"Archived-not-public-use",* and releases for public use will have *"Public-use"* assigned.

**Please respect the meaning of the tags.**
