# Welcome to the Repository!
This repository is going to be a personally used/release repo for project I am working on, release to public, and any old projects that anyone can use if they feel. This have NO warranty, may contain security issues, and, if you want to use it, may require being worked on.

### How to obtain a specific project
Each project will have its own directory in the repo that will be pulled and pushed to. No new branches *should* be made, unless I use them for current projects and for their versioning control.

Security is **AS IS, NOT GUARANTEED, AND HAS NO WARRANTY.**

Any current project being developed will have security pages as well.

- Current projects will have the *"Current-project"* tag. May be only given a link to their repo in the status area below.

- Old projects **NOT** for public release will have *"Archived-not-public-use"*.

- Releases for public use will have *"Public-use"* assigned.

- Projects that may be restarted later on will be assigned the *"Be-Revived-Later"* tag. These may be projects that were once abandoned and might be worked and re-worked later in the future. These projects will have a link to their repo in the status area below., especially if they will be turned into an *"Current-Project"*.

- The *"Future-Project"* tag will be assigned to projects and things that I might work on later, most likely given their own repo, and will have a link to their repo in the status area below.
these will also be under the "releases" section along with a list here when they are published.

**Please respect the meaning of the tags.**
